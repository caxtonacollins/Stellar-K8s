# Stellar-K8s: Cloud-Native Stellar Infrastructure

![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built%20with-Rust-orange?style=for-the-badge&logo=rust) ![Kubernetes](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kubernetes-Operator-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=kubernetes) ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-green?style=for-the-badge) ![CI/CD](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/stellar/stellar-k8s/ci.yml?style=for-the-badge&label=Build)

> **Production-grade Stellar infrastructure in one command.**

**Stellar-K8s** is a high-performance Kubernetes Operator written in strict Rust using `kube-rs`. It automates the deployment, management, and scaling of **Stellar Core**, **Horizon**, and **Soroban RPC** nodes, bringing the power of Cloud-Native patterns to the Stellar ecosystem.

Designed for high availability, type safety, and minimal footprint.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **🦀 Rust-Native Performance**: Built with `kube-rs` and `Tokio` for an ultra-lightweight footprint (~15MB binary) and complete memory safety.
- **🛡️ Enterprise Reliability**: Type-safe error handling prevents runtime failures. Built-in `Finalizers` ensure clean PVC and resource cleanup.
- **🏥 Auto-Sync Health Checks**: Automatically monitors Horizon and Soroban RPC nodes, only marking them Ready when fully synced with the network.
- **GitOps Ready**: Fully compatible with ArgoCD and Flux for declarative infrastructure management.
- **📈 Observable by Default**: Native Prometheus metrics integration for monitoring node health, ledger sync status, and resource usage.
- **⚡ Soroban Ready**: First-class support for Soroban RPC nodes with captive core configuration.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Stellar-K8s follows the **Operator Pattern**, extending Kubernetes with a `StellarNode` Custom Resource Definition (CRD).

1.  **CRD Source of Truth**: You define your node requirements (Network, Type, Resources) in a `StellarNode` manifest.
2.  **Reconciliation Loop**: The Rust-based controller watches for changes and drives the cluster state to match your desired specification.
3.  **Stateful Management**: Automatically handles complex lifecycle events for Validators (StatefulSets) and RPC nodes (Deployments), including persistent storage and configuration.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Kubernetes cluster** (1.28+)
- **kubectl** configured
- **Helm 3.x** (for operator installation)
- **Rust 1.88+** (for local development)
  - CI/CD and Docker builds use Rust 1.93 for consistency
  - Contributors can use any Rust 1.88+ version locally

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get a Testnet node running in under 5 minutes.

### 1. Install the Operator via Helm

```bash
# Add the helm repo (example)
helm repo add stellar-k8s https://stellar.github.io/stellar-k8s
helm repo update

# Install the operator
helm install stellar-operator stellar-k8s/stellar-operator \
  --namespace stellar-system \
  --create-namespace
```

### 2. Deploy a Testnet Validator

Apply the following manifest to your cluster:

```yaml
# validator.yaml
apiVersion: stellar.org/v1alpha1
kind: StellarNode
metadata:
  name: my-validator
  namespace: stellar
spec:
  nodeType: Validator
  network: Testnet
  version: "v21.0.0"
  storage:
    storageClass: "standard"
    size: "100Gi"
    retentionPolicy: Retain
  validatorConfig:
    seedSecretRef: "my-validator-seed" # Pre-created K8s secret
    enableHistoryArchive: true
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f validator.yaml
kubectl get stellarnodes -n stellar
```

### 3. Use the kubectl-stellar Plugin

The project includes a kubectl plugin for convenient interaction with StellarNode resources:

```bash
# Build the plugin
cargo build --release --bin kubectl-stellar
cp target/release/kubectl-stellar ~/.local/bin/kubectl-stellar

# List all StellarNode resources
kubectl stellar list

# Check sync status
kubectl stellar status

# View logs from a node
kubectl stellar logs my-validator -f
```

See [kubectl-plugin.md](docs/kubectl-plugin.md) for complete documentation.
